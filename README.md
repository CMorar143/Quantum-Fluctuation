## A Brief Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is one of the most important pillars in not only modern physics but in all of modern science. It is the science of the really small. It details the nature and interactions of sub-atomic particles such as protons and neutrons and even the more elementary particles such as quarks (the constituents of protons and neutrons). These particles (along with others) make up all the matter and energy we are familiar with in the universe. This has a simple yet important implication; quantum mechanics is a gateway into the true understanding of reality.

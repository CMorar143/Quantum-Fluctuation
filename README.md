# Quantum-Fluctuation

## A Brief Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (QM)

Quantum mechanics is one of the most important pillars in not only modern physics but in all of modern science. It is the science of the really small. It details the nature and interactions of sub-atomic particles such as protons and neutrons and even the more elementary particles such as quarks (the constituents of protons and neutrons). These particles (along with others) make up all the matter and energy we are familiar with in the universe. This has a simple yet important implication; quantum mechanics is a gateway into the true understanding of reality.


## The Weirdness of Quantum Mechanics

Despite QM being the description of the fundamental nature of reality, it comes with some profound implications. QM has been criticised by many (including Albert Einstein!) as being too "spooky". The feature of QM that I will focus on here is known as quantum fluctuation. QM tells us that fluctuations in quantum fields can result in two particles (one matter and one anti-matter) popping into existence out of nothing! These particles quickly rejoin and annihilate.


## Goal of This Project

The goal of this project is to create a visualisation of quantum flucations. QM tells us that empty space is not in fact empty. It's actually a bubbling bath of matter particles and their anti-mater counterparts popping in and out of existence. I aim to create a visualisation of this using the unity game engine.
